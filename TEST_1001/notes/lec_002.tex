If velocity is a measurement of the rate of change of position, what is the measurement
of the rate of change of velocity?

\begin{definition}{Acceleration}
  Acceleration is a change in velocity over time. It is the measurement of the rate of
  change of velocity.
\end{definition}

It is important to remember that, just like velocity, acceleration is also a vector meaning
that is measures both a magnitude and a direction.

\begin{formula}{Average Acceleration}
  \begin{align*}
    \textup{Average acceleration} &= \textup{change in velocity over time elapsed} \\
    \textup{Average acceleration} &= \frac{\textup{change in velocity}}{\textup{time elapsed}} \\
    \overrightarrow{a}            &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
  \end{align*}
\end{formula}

The direction of acceleration is the direction of the \textbf{change} of velocity. Notably,
the direction of velocity has no bearing on the direction of acceleration. In Figure \ref{fig:007},
the direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of velocity since the velocity
is the velocity is going in the same direction from $t=1$ to $t=2$ and it increases in magnitude.

In Figure \ref{fig:008}, the direction of acceleration is in the opposite direction of the
velocity of the object since the magnitude of velocity at $t=2$ is less than the magnitude
at $t=1$ but still in the same direction.

\subsection{Kinematics}

\begin{definition}{Kinematics}
  A branch of physics dedicated to describing the mechanics of motion.
\end{definition}

Assuming that we have constant acceleration, we can use \textbf{Kinematic Equations} to
describe motion.

\begin{formula}{Kinematic Equations}
  \begin{align*}
    v_{final} &= v_{initial}+a \cdot \Delta t                                                                            \\
    v         &= v_{0}+a \cdot \Delta t                                                                                  \\
  \end{align*}
  \vspace{-25pt}
  \hrule
  \begin{align*}
    x_{final} &= x_{initial}+v_{initial}\cdot (t_{final} - t_{initial})+\frac{1}{2}a \cdot (t_{final} - t_{initial})^{2} \\
    x         &= x_{0}+v_{0}\cdot \Delta t+\frac{1}{2}a \cdot \Delta t^{2}                                               \\
  \end{align*}
  \vspace{-25pt}
  \hrule
  \begin{align*}
    v_{final}^{2} &= v_{initial}^{2}+2a(x_{final}-x_{initial})                                                           \\
    v^{2}         &= v_{0}^{2}+2a(x-x_{0})                                                                               \\
  \end{align*}

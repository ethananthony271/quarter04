\section{Motion in One Dimension}

\subsection{Position}

If an object is in motion, what quantities must be known to predict its position at a
certain time? First, what is position?

\begin{definition}{Position}
  A description of where an object is located.
\end{definition}

In Figure \ref{fig:001}, there is an object at position $x=2.5$. This is defined based on
the number line that the object is positioned on. In Figure \ref{fig:002}, the object is
positioned at $x=5.5$ despite not having moved. This highlights the importance of recognizing
the reference frame when describing an object and its properties.

\subsection{Motion}

\begin{definition}{Reference Frame}
  A reference frame is the context in which the values are described. This extends to the
  context of the motion, position, energy, etc. of the description.
\end{definition}

Objects not only have position, but also experience motion. When an object undergoes motion,
it is displaced. In Figure \ref{fig:003}, an object moved to the right (within our reference
frame) from $x=4$ to $x=7$, resulting in a displacement of $\Delta x=3$. In Figure
\ref{fig:004}, an object first moves from $x=5$ to $x=3$, then from $x=3$ to $x=7$, resulting
in a final displacement of $\Delta x=2$.

\begin{definition}{Displacement}
  An object's net \textbf{change in position}.
\end{definition}

\newpage

In Figure \ref{fig:005}, the position ($x$) of two objects is graphed over time ($t$).
For object 1, its displacement is constantly changing throughout the entire time. However,
for object 2, its displacement starts by increasing, then at $t=c$, its displacement starts
decreasing until it ends with a negative displacement. For object 2, it maintains a
constant speed throughout the entire time, but its velocity changes. This is because speed
is a \textbf{scalar} measurement, while velocity is a \textbf{vector} meaning that speed
measures \textbf{magnitude} while velocity measures both \textbf{magnitude and direction}.

How can speed and velocity be quantitatively represented? Through equations!

\begin{formula}{Speed and Velocity}
  \begin{align*}
    \textup{\textbf{Speed}}  & \textup{\ is distance traveled over time elapsed.}         \\
    \textup{Speed}           &= \frac{\textup{distance traveled}}{\textup{time elapsed}}  \\
    v                        &= \frac{x}{t}
  \end{align*}
  \begin{align*}
  \textup{\textbf{Velocity}} & \textup{\ is change in position over time elapsed}         \\
    \textup{Velocity}        &= \frac{\textup{change in position}}{\textup{time elapsed}} \\
    \overrightarrow{v}       &= \frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{x}}{\Delta t}
  \end{align*}
\end{formula}

\subsection{Acceleration}

  \includestandalone{figures/fig_006}
  \caption{Instantaneous vs. Average Velocity}
  \label{fig:006}
\end{wrapfigure}

There is also a difference between an instantaneous value and an average value. In Figure
\ref{fig:006}, the average velocity of the object is represented by the dotted line,
showing a slow and negative average velocity. However, from the start to point $A$, the
velocity is fast and positive; from point $A$ to point $B$, the velocity is fast and
negative; and from point $B$ to point $C$, the velocity is slow and positive.

\begin{definition}{Instantaneous vs. Average}
  Instantaneous measures a value at a \textbf{single point} in time the same way calculus
  is used to find the slope of a function at a single point. Average measures the mean
  value over a period of time.
\end{definition}
